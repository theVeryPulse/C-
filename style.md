## [Con: Constants and immutability](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#con-constants-and-immutability)
### Con.1: By default, make objects immutable
Function parameters passed by value are rarely mutated, but also rarely declared const. To avoid confusion and lots of false positives, donâ€™t enforce this rule for function parameters.

```c++
void g(const int i) { ... }  // pedantic
```

### Con.2: By default, make member functions `const`
### Con.3: By default, pass pointers and references to `const`s
### Con.4: Use `const` to define objects with values that do not change after construction


### NL.16: Use a conventional class member declaration order
Reason

A conventional order of members improves readability.

When declaring a class use the following order
- types: classes, enums, and aliases (using)
- constructors, assignments, destructor
- functions
- data
